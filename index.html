<p><i>Part of my <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/2024/05/09/godzilla-heisei-era.html">series of reviews</a> of the <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Heisei_era">Heisei era</a> Godzilla movies. <strong>Spoilers within</strong>, but we&rsquo;re talking 80&rsquo;s Godzilla movies here.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Americans ruin everything. <strong>Again.</strong></i></p>
<p><em>Godzilla 1985</em> is the Americanized cut of <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/2024/06/01/return-of-godzilla.html"><em>Return of Godzilla</em></a>. The latter is one of my favorite Godzilla movies. Compared to the rest of the Heisei series, it&rsquo;s a little darker, slower, and more narrowly focused. It&rsquo;s almost meditative at times.</p>
<p><em>Godzilla 1985</em> is none of those things.</p>
<p>It is, however, pretty much exactly what you&rsquo;d expect when you give a subtle, even nuanced (by Goji standards) movie to an American studio to adapt for western audiences during the tail end of the cold war. Gone are pretty much any character moments or even character&hellip; traits from most of the original cast. Characters exist solely for exposition and, in any given scene, only the bare minimum of dialog necessary for explaining what is happening remains.</p>
<p>However the movie does add something only America can provide: one Raymond Burr. And he&rsquo;s almost enough to save this movie from itself. Almost.</p>
<p>Reprising his role from the American cut of the OG <em>Godzilla</em> from 1956, Burr is back, for some reason called in by the US Government to advise on the situation unfolding in Japan. The movie still generally follows the events of the original. Godzilla is back, and heading for Tokyo. And America, despite never being asked, has its nose right in the middle of it.</p>
<p>Why <em>is</em> the American government so on-the-edge-of-their-seat obsessed with monitoring the situation in Japan when it doesn&rsquo;t actually involve them or pose a threat to any American interest? And why is there literally no one else they can call for context other than one random news reporter who happened to be in Japan thirty years ago? Shh. This is America. We don&rsquo;t ask questions. Not here, in the land of old white generals who&rsquo;d rather be on the putting green and spunky underlings spewing quips while sipping on a <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Dr_Pepper">cool, refreshing Dr. Pepper</a>.</p>
<p>Watching this movie gives me some insight into the American pop culture opinion on Japanese Godzilla movies, especially before our own Monsterverse hit the seen. &ldquo;Cheesy vapid kids movies featuring men in rubber suits stomping around plywood Tokyo.&rdquo; Now, the Showa era didn&rsquo;t always do a lot to challenge that perception, but the if American cuts of these movies are the only things most people were familiar with, its no wonder they have only a surface level understanding and appreciation of the series. We&rsquo;ve filtered out any theme, thought, or heart from movies that are routinely about even bigger ideas than giant irradiated badass lizards.</p>
<p><em>Godzilla 1985</em> strips every bit of character and discussion of deeper themes from this movie. Every &ldquo;idea&rdquo; the original had is gone. The result is, somewhat ironically, that the only source of any kind of depth of thought comes from Raymond Burr himself. He seems to be the only American involved with this movie with any kind of respect and understanding for the source material and for Godzilla himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nature has a way, sometimes, of reminding Man of just how small he is. She occasionally throws up the terrible offsprings of our pride and carelessness&hellip; to remind us of how puny we really are in the face of a tornado, an earthquake, or a Godzilla. The reckless ambitions of Man are often dwarfed by their dangerous consequences. For now, Godzilla - that strangely innocent and tragic monster - has gone to earth. Whether he returns or not, or is never again seen by human eyes, the things he has taught us&hellip; remain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I mean <em>that</em> line would not be out of place in a Japanese Godzilla movie. And Raymond freakin' Burr delivers it with the gravitas that Gojira-san truly deserves. Its a shame then that the above quote accounts for like 50% of Burr&rsquo;s screen time in the entire movie.</p>
<p>With as much as they cut of the original, I figured they <em>must</em> be adding a lot of Burr-centric scenes! But no, he&rsquo;s barely in the movie, as underused as any of the original cast. The American cut is shorter just for being shorter&rsquo;s sake. Which, all things considered, was maybe for the best.</p>
<p>I said that this movie largely follows the plot of the original, but that&rsquo;s actually not true, in that the original was as much about the Prime Minister of Japan navigating the internal and external politics of Godzilla&rsquo;s reappearance, as it is about Godzilla&rsquo;s building-stomping, atomic-breath-blasting return. In the Japanese version, while the government is deciding whether or not to reveal that they believe Goji is back, he sinks a Soviet sub. The Russians assume the Americans are responsible for this, and so to avoid an international conflict, Japan&rsquo;s hand is forced, and they go public with the news that Godzilla is back and sunk the sub. Immediately the Russians and the Americans send their ambassadors to the Prime Minister to demand they each be allowed to use nukes (<em>on Japanese soil!</em>) to solve the problem.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister and his crew pretty quickly realize that both the USA and USSR actually just want to use this as an excuse to play with some of their new nuclear toys in someone else&rsquo;s backyard, and so they shut that shit down and say no, you cannot bomb our country to stop Godzilla from destroying our country.  The ambassadors pout and go home.</p>
<p>We then meet a Russian official, whose job is to shut down the nuclear control boat that the Russians secretly set up in Tokyo harbor. He is bound by his duty to honor the Japanese government&rsquo;s wishes, but as he&rsquo;s trying to power down the targeting computer, Godzilla attacks the harbor and boat is damaged, triggering a launch. Injured, the Russian official does everything he can to complete his mission, and eventually uses his dying breath to try and stop the launch - but is ultimately unsuccessful.</p>
<p><strong>Except that&rsquo;s not at all what happens in the American version.</strong> The USA and USSR are still shut down by the Prime Minister in this one, but when we see the Russian control boat, the English subtitles of Russian dialog tell us that the Russian official is all like, Well too bad, I&rsquo;m launching the space nuke anyway because fuck you, that&rsquo;s why. This time, as Godzilla is attacking, he&rsquo;s all, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCpjgl2baLs&amp;t=58s">MOTHERLAND</a>! and uses his dying breath to intentionally fire ze missile.</p>
<p>(And: <em>they don&rsquo;t even change the Russian language lines</em>! Just the subtitles! So if you actually knew Russian watching this movie, you&rsquo;d be like, WTF, mate? But of course no red-blooded American would be as unpatriotic to ever know Russian!)</p>
<p>In both versions, the Japanese Prime Minster asks the Americans if they can intercept the missile, but in the American version this comes across as the Westerners sweeping in to save the day, while in the original it was much more of a commentary that the evils and dangers of nuclear weaponry are perhaps necessary or at least unavoidable in this era.</p>
<p>So yeah, <em>Godzilla 1985</em> was a trip. It&rsquo;s a shining example of the time period and politics in which it was made. It&rsquo;s also a bastardization of a great movie, made <em>almost</em> bearable by silver fox Raymond Burr being his Raymond Burr-iest.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s okay. I&rsquo;m sure the next attempt the Americans make on ol' Goji will be better, right?</p>

			 <p>I find myself retreating to the past.</p>
<p>Is it retreat?</p>
<p>In some ways, it is an entirely natural progression. For the last few years, I&rsquo;ve felt myself becoming increasingly disconnected with the broad, forward momentum of pop culture. I find myself caring less about new movies, TV shows, books, video games. And I find myself caring even less about Caring About those things. With gaming specifically, early last year I realized that I would rather have Playing Video Games be my hobby than Following The Gaming Industry.  My own collection has grown so much, coupled with my own executive functional failures in actually engaging with my hobbies and playing games, that I don&rsquo;t actually <em>want</em> more games. I desperately want to connect with what I have around me, that I&rsquo;ve been piling up - hoarding really - for some future imagined day. Well, that day is here.</p>
<p>And that sentiment rapidly expanded beyond games; I have so many books I&rsquo;ve never read, movies I&rsquo;ve never watched. And then of course there are the movies/books/games etc. that I <em>have</em> engaged with that were so meaningful that I want to engage with them <em>again</em>. Ain&rsquo;t nobody got time for that! Because I realized I had become fixated on <em>acquisition</em> and <em>curation</em>, and I lost the ability to <em>play</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>engage</em> and <strong><em>enjoy</em></strong> all the amazing art I worked so hard to stockpile.</p>
<p>But where I am at right now is about more than just making a concerted effort to do things. I seem to have landed in 1985. And 1999. And 1972.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in 1985 via <strong>Project &lsquo;85</strong>, a meticulously plotted course I&rsquo;ve devised through classic WWF content starting roughly around the first Wrestlemania and working its way through the mid 80&rsquo;s.  I&rsquo;m in 1999 via my music library where I&rsquo;ve been re-engaging with the most formative music from my youth&hellip; which has also deposited me in 1972 with <strong>Jethro Tull</strong> where I am working my way through their catalog with a new appreciation. You ever listen to your favorite music so much that you kind of become numb to it for a while? That happened with me and Tull, and I didn&rsquo;t listen to them at much all for the last few years. Its been long enough now that I can re-approach them with fresh ears and from a new phase in life. And yet I feel like a kid again, spread out on the living room floor with my dad&rsquo;s record collection, reading the lyrics on the record sleeves and losing myself in the album artwork.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the goal of all of this, really - to engage with my passions like I did as a kid. With unreserved abandon. With my whole heart. Without having a plan. Without managing a list or a schedule. My entire adult life, to some degree, I&rsquo;ve struggled to just <strong>do</strong> the things I want to do. But I didn&rsquo;t struggle like that as a kid. I just&hellip; did things. Oh, I totally had ADHD as a kid - I realize all the time the ways it manifested when I was young that I (and the adults around me) never noticed - but it didn&rsquo;t keep me from doing the things that brought me joy like it does now. Now, I tie myself in knots because I can&rsquo;t seem to finish any video game I start; when I was a kid, I didn&rsquo;t know you <em>could</em> finish a game. They ended? I was shocked when I learned that. I just&hellip; played them. And that was enough. It wasn&rsquo;t just enough, it was the <em>point</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to play again. I&rsquo;m trying to approach the things I love with the full yet unencumbered heart of a child and divorce myself from all the baggage around everything that this modern age has bestowed upon us. And it&rsquo;s working.</p>

			 <p>There have been various times when reading books was the most important activity in my life. And there have certainly been times when it is the most common one. But for the last few years I&rsquo;ve struggled to finish any book I&rsquo;ve started - and I haven&rsquo;t even started that many.</p>
<p>In fact I&rsquo;ve struggled to do a lot of the things that are important to me in the recent years. Hobbies, interests, creative expression. Oh sure I&rsquo;ll do <em>things</em>, fun things even, things I like! But never in any sort of consistent manner, never making progress on longer projects, and never feeling like I was engaged in a <em>practice</em>, a habit - instead: just random fits and starts and then fizzle-out. Since I got married and moved in with my partner in 2019, it&rsquo;s like every routine I had in my life dissolved and never reformed. The pandemic clearly didn&rsquo;t help. Neither did getting diagnosed with ADHD right before the pandemic started.</p>
<p>Yeah that ADHD thing, it probably hasn&rsquo;t been helping the whole time, huh?</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s not what this is about. Whining about how my executives refuse to function, and I can&rsquo;t seem to do any of the silly things that are meaningful to me? What is this, my journals??</p>
<p>Nah nah. I am here to say that <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/2025/06/26/reading-the-phoenix-guard-by.html">I have started a book</a> I really enjoy and I intend to finish it. And most unlikely of all, I actually think I might. Now, full disclosure, I am 50+ pages into a 480ish-page book, so there is still plenty of time for this to go off the rails and join the other books I&rsquo;ve abandoned over the last few years. But I don&rsquo;t think it will. Because this isn&rsquo;t happening in a vacuum. This isn&rsquo;t a random spurt of energy I&rsquo;m desperately trying to coax into Inspiration or Consistency.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve actually just been putting the time in. Learning what works for me, and what doesn&rsquo;t. Trying to stop holding myself up to what I &ldquo;should&rdquo; be doing, and instead focusing on what I actually think I might be able to do. I&rsquo;ve spent years learning what doesn&rsquo;t work  for me. And yet every time the wheel turns, I deploy the same assortment of tactics that failed me the last go &lsquo;round.</p>
<p>Lately though, it&rsquo;s been different, and I&rsquo;m getting things done. Important, meaningful things like playing video games and watching wrestling. You may think I&rsquo;m kidding but when you are lying in bed at night recapping your day, what gave it meaning? Was it work? Facebook? An out-of-balance checkbook? Our passions are the only thing we can count on, now and forever. I am finally finding a way to fashion my passions into a bulwark against the coming/already-here storm. My fortress is lined with comic books and patrolled by professional wrestlers. My cats and partner are here with me and the reading light is good. That&rsquo;s good enough for me.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more work to be done. There&rsquo;s always more work to be done. But at least I am building on something, instead of cleaning the debris and starting from scratch again. I&rsquo;ll take it.</p>
<p>Onward.</p>

<p><i>Part of my <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/2024/05/09/godzilla-heisei-era.html">series of reviews</a> of the <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Heisei_era">Heisei era</a> Godzilla movies. <strong>Spoilers within</strong>, but we&rsquo;re talking 80&rsquo;s Godzilla movies here.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Godzilla fights a giant plant monster. <s>Again.</s>(!!!)</i></p>
<p>This and <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/2024/06/01/return-of-godzilla.html"><em>Return of Godzilla</em></a> could almost be a mini-series unto themselves. Not just because this one picks up moments after the end of the last one, but because they both share a certain &ldquo;feel&rdquo; that is hard to describe but lands very well for me.</p>
<p>This is another dark, somber Godzilla movie. As dark and somber as a movie with a giant plant monster, international assassins, psychics, and rogue American biotech companies can be, anyway. This movie is not as &ldquo;small&rdquo; as the last one, but still feels more focused and deliberate than the rest of the Heisei series.</p>
<p>Biollante herself has a very unique (for a Kaiju) backstory, though I wish they would have done a little more with the &ldquo;soul of my dead daughter in the monster&rdquo; thing. Biollante&rsquo;s origins are interesting, but her actions and role in the narrative don&rsquo;t do enough with the concept. It would have been very interesting to see a creature torn between her human soul and her monstrous cells. This is hinted at, but I wanted more.</p>
<p>The human characters here are all great. The scientist father, Genichiro Shiragami, was a different kind of &ldquo;jaded scholar&rdquo;, and while not outright villainous, was certainly flawed in interesting ways. The two government agents, Sho Kuroki and Goro Gondo, were particularly enjoyable, and added a kind of &ldquo;buddy cop&rdquo; vibe to the movie which largely worked. I really like Gondo and can totally see him and Yuki from <em>vs SpaceGodzilla</em> as brothers, making that addition to <em>vs SpaceGodzilla</em> pay even more dividends in retrospect. (And now I want to write fan fiction about their earlier adventures as bros&hellip;)</p>
<p>We also meet Miki for the first time in this one, and while she doesn&rsquo;t have the most depth of character, I liked seeing her at the start of her journey as a student, knowing how she&rsquo;ll grow and change and become a teacher and advocate herself.</p>
<p>This movie does have some of the worst English acting I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a Godzilla movie - not the dub, but the non-Japanese actors playing American characters and speaking English just utterly suck.</p>
<p>The final confrontation between Godzilla and Biollante was particularly enjoyable. Biollante&rsquo;s final form was great, the battle was intense, and while the anti-nuclear bacteria plot that got us to that point was a little convoluted, I liked how the all the different plot threads came together to be resolved through some hot kaiju-on-kaiju action.</p>
<p>This one is hard to find, but worth watching any way you can.</p>

<p><i>Part of my <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/2024/05/09/godzilla-heisei-era.html">series of reviews</a> of the <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Heisei_era">Heisei era</a> Godzilla movies. <strong>Spoilers within</strong>, but we&rsquo;re talking 80&rsquo;s Godzilla movies here.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Godzilla is back, baby! Again.</i></p>
<p>Godzilla is back again for the first time and everyone is freaking out. This is a very good Godzilla movie. Watching it at the end of the <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Heisei_era">Heisei series</a> is interesting, because while it very deliberately takes a more serious approach than the late-<a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Showa_era">Showa</a> movies, it also has the same effect when compared to the rest of the Heisei series. That&rsquo;s not to say that the Heisei series gets even a fraction as ridiculous as the older movies, but no matter where you slice it or where it falls one&rsquo;s Godzilla viewing chronology, this is a serious, somber, and in some ways <em>smaller</em> movie than most others, and all of those things work very well in this context.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s weird calling a Godzilla move &ldquo;small&rdquo; and weirder still meaning it as a compliment. But this movie, while having very high stakes is still tightly focused and zeroes-in on very specific moments and interactions. On the monster front, one of the most striking scenes was Godzilla destroying the nuclear plant. Not a whole city, or an entire army of troops and vehicles, but one compound. We see the whole razing from beginning to end, and it really conveys the terror and destruction of Godzilla. He doesn&rsquo;t need a whole country to destroy to feel like an unstoppable, god-like force.</p>
<p>One the human side, we spend a lot of time on the geopolitical drama of Godzilla&rsquo;s impending return. I loved all the scenes with the prime minister trying to navigate an impossible situation made more complicated by the Americans and Soviets waving their nuclear dicks around. These scenes work because they are &ldquo;small&rdquo;. The prime minister conveys so much just by listening to everything going on around him, taking it all in while holding up to the massive stakes around him. It takes the Godzilla movie trope of the bureaucratic response to Godzilla and grounds it and nails it.</p>
<p>The rest of the human characters aren&rsquo;t bad either. I wish we could have got a little more of a romantic relationship developed between Naoko Okumura and the reporter, Goro Maki. As is my custom, I loved the older, slightly jaded scientist character, Dr. Hayashida most of all.</p>
<p>Godzilla feels appropriately menacing in this one, but the suit itself is a little stiff and eyes don&rsquo;t quite work. But the overall silhouette is great; this suit sets the new template. By the <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Godzilla_vs._Biollante">next film</a>, they&rsquo;ve addressed the minor issues I mentioned and we have one of the best and most consistent designs for Godzilla that is then used for the rest of the Heisei movies.</p>
<p>Also, there is just something about the <em>look</em> of this one (and <em>vs Biollante</em>) that none of the other Heisei movies quite ever capture. I can&rsquo;t describe it very well, but it&rsquo;s a graininess or filter or something that I just really, really like in those two movies and that none of the other movies seem to have.</p>
<p>A great re-introduction to Godzilla, and a good time no matter where it falls in your viewing chronology.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: Godzilla dies. Again.</i></p>
<p>Following more or less the format of <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Godzilla_vs._Mechagodzilla_II"><em>vs Mechagodzilla</em></a>, this one gets right into the action and the story. The opening scene is the best of the series: welcome to the movie, Godzilla is here and he&rsquo;s on fire and pissed. The whole meltdown Godzilla look is great and the big guy seems to be both enraged and suffering here and it works.</p>
<p>Every aspect of this movie works and works well together. The humans aren&rsquo;t the most engaging of the series, but they get the job done and I like the connection to the original movie and characters. Godzilla Jr. is un-chibi-fied and his role in this story feels much more like a direct continuation of the character&rsquo;s &ldquo;arc&rdquo; from <em>vs Mechagodzilla</em>. In fact, in a lot of ways this movie feels like the direct sequel to <em>vs Mechagodzilla</em> that &ldquo;could have been.&rdquo; <em>vs SpaceGodzilla</em> (<a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Godzilla_vs._SpaceGodzilla">the movie</a>) could be erased from the series and the two around it would flow very well into one another. (But I would be sad.)</p>
<p>Destoroyah is not my favorite enemy kaiju but it is up there. My only problem is not so much with the look but with how stiff he/they are in some scenes. The human-sized, earlier forms are a great design and, when the director takes advantage of horror movie-style framing and cinematography, the lack of movement is hidden well. But sometimes in wide shots they are just suits on wheels and it takes you out of the moment. Similarly, the &ldquo;perfect form&rdquo; looks amazing but its massive size doesn&rsquo;t always come off as imposing and godlike but instead bulky and stiff. Still, I always love seeing a baddie tower above Godzilla.</p>
<p>The ending fight is great and the effect of Godzilla&rsquo;s death is haunting, and has an amazing score accompanying it. I love how Junior is resurrected and takes on the mantle. Tokyo is destroyed and saved all at once by Godzilla and his legacy, and I think that was an incredibly appropriate way to end this movie and this series.</p>
<p>One of the best Godzilla movies, in the series and the franchise.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: Godzilla fights an evil monster from space. Again.</i></p>
<p>Okay, so this one is clearly filler, and okay, it doesn&rsquo;t hold up as well, coming after  <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/2024/05/18/godzilla-vs-mechagodzilla.html"><em>vs Mechagodzilla</em></a> - but I love this movie, warts and all. And it has warts. Godzilla cells getting sucked through a black hole and undergoing &ldquo;rapid evolution&rdquo;? The random, utterly pointless Yakuza side plot? Chibi Baby Godzilla? I don&rsquo;t care, I love it all even when it doesn&rsquo;t work. And SpaceGodzilla himself, while nonsensical even for a kaiju, still looks rad as hell and the crystal motif is interesting and unique. I particularly like the way it transforms the landscape and creates a larger arena for the final battle.</p>
<p>Another reason I like this one so much are the human characters, particularly Yuki. He&rsquo;s so strangely captivating with his droopy-eyed, apathetic badassery. &ldquo;I love you, Yuki.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fill my lighter for me.&rdquo; Ugh, it&rsquo;s trash and I love it. Also Miki continues to evolve and have a role in the plot, and seems to have changed as a person since the events of the last movie&hellip;and then: ROMANCE??</p>
<p>This movie doesn&rsquo;t need to be anything more than giant monster fun and a little human drama and it delivers on both, but doesn&rsquo;t really do anything that is new or better than previous entries. That&rsquo;s okay. I have an unusual fondness for this movie and that&rsquo;s enough for me.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: Godzilla fights a giant robot shaped like him. Again.</i></p>
<p>Now THIS is what I&rsquo;m talking about. Just a simple sci-fi action flick that also ends up having a lot of heart. I love pretty much everything about this one. Even Rodan! That bastard actually ends up being a bro in this one!</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s not to like? Mechagodzilla is legit cool looking and intimidating. Baby Godzilla is cute and expressive. The humans are pretty interesting, if not the most well-developed the series has seen. And so much Godzilla screen time! Apparently, <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Godzilla_vs._Mechagodzilla_II#Trivia">this is the most he&rsquo;s been on screen</a> in the whole series, and it shows.</p>
<p>The monsters really steal the show here, and actually have pretty developed and interesting motivations. Is Rodan stealing eggs or protecting his &ldquo;step brother&rdquo;? I was actually invested in figuring this out, and I usually hate that guy. Godzilla has a pretty clear motivation and once his through-line has concluded, he just walks away in the end. The humans don&rsquo;t win, but things actually resolve.</p>
<p>The movie is paced well and doesn&rsquo;t waste any time getting into cool looking sci-fi monster mayhem. Baby Godzilla, which shouldn&rsquo;t work at all, totally steals the show and never gets too cutesie or annoying. And Miki the psychic actually has things to do!</p>
<p>This is a good one and it will be hard to beat as my favorite of the Heisei era. Can <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/SpaceGodzilla">CrystalShoulderPadsZilla</a> do it? We&rsquo;ll see!</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: Mothra upstages Godzilla. Again.</i></p>
<p>Whereas <a href=""><em>Godzilla vs King Ghidorah</em></a> tried to do <em>a lot</em>, this one tries to do one thing and does it over and over and over: remind us humans that we are ruining the earth. Godzilla movies are not known for their subtlety but this one was so heavy handed with the environmental message - which itself is never more nuanced than, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing bad things and we should stop&rdquo; - that it becomes annoying and boring. It doesn&rsquo;t help we have some pretty forgettable human characters, and frankly, even Godzilla himself doesn&rsquo;t have much to do in this one. Apparently this was originally <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Mothra_vs._Bagan#Trivia">a Mothra movie</a> script that they adapted into a Godzilla movie, and it really shows. Godzilla has so little bearing on the plot that it wouldn&rsquo;t be hard to imagine a version of this without him all together. That&rsquo;s a problem for a, ya know, Godzilla movie.</p>
<p>So many of the human characters are just here to say the same ham-fisted environmental message over and over. The two leads, Takuya and his ex-wife Masako, could have been interesting with their reconciliation plot, but instead their plot is just kind of boring. Not to mention the fact that Takuya makes such an out-of-nowhere decision that seems totally counter to what little character development he had: namely stealing and trying to sell the <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Shobijin#Heisei_era">Cosmos</a>. It makes no sense! And it&rsquo;s completely unnecessary! The Cosmos have <em>already</em> been stolen by someone else, motivating Mothra&rsquo;s attack! There is literally no reason for him to do this; they could have reconciled him with his family in any number of other, more sensical ways.</p>
<p>Also, while I love Mothra, I always get bored when she spends half a movie as a caterpillar. Mothra as a moth always looks so rad. Who actually is interested in seeing a pink slug for half the movie? Give us the Queen of the Monsters at her most regal!</p>
<p>One high point though was the score, especially the Mothra themes. Also Battra is generally a pretty cool design, even in <s>Metapod</s> caterpillar form. The undersea battle between him and Godzilla was exciting and felt different. Also, I really like the actor playing Ando, mainly because he&rsquo;s one of my favorite human character in the franchise, playing the dad, Yuji Shinoda, in <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Godzilla_2000:_Millennium"><em>Godzilla 2000</em></a>.</p>
<p>Overall, a pretty mediocre, borderline forgettable Godzilla movie.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert: White people ruin everything. Again.</i></p>
<p>This movie tried to do a lot, and while I&rsquo;m not sure how much it succeeded in most of it, I can&rsquo;t deny it was enjoyable and engaging.</p>
<p>The plot is overly-complicated, and the time travel doesn&rsquo;t even hold up to most pop-culture time travel logical standards. The movie really wants to say <em>something</em> about Japan&rsquo;s complicated relationship with 1) Godzilla, 2) the West, 3) Nuclear power; and while it does indeed Say Things about all of that&hellip; I&rsquo;m not sure exactly <em>what</em> points it&rsquo;s actually trying to make. But it sure is fun to go along for the ride.</p>
<p>There are a few different ways to structure these kinds of movies, and this one goes for First Half: Characters and Story, Second Half: Monster Mayhem. I personally prefer the structure where the monsters are introduced from the beginning and their presence builds gradually throughout the movie until they dominate the narrative by the end, but in this case, the first-half sci-fi plot is entertaining, if convoluted. And I get why they wanted the first time you see Godzilla in the movie to be his pre-kaiju, dinosaur form. But this one goes in the file of &ldquo;Godzilla Movies That Could Have Used More Godzilla&rdquo; (see also, the first <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Godzilla_(2014_film)">Monsterverse <em>Godzilla</em></a>, and <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Godzilla_Minus_One"><em>Minus One</em></a>).</p>
<p>There are a lot of engaging characters in this movie, but none of them are very deep or realized. For some reason the creepy <a href="https://wikizilla.org/wiki/Futurian">white people</a> entertained me to no end, and the idea of the villains from the future (and from the past) all being weird looking white dudes I believe was intentional and related to the above-mentioned attempts at Saying Things. But man, they were creepy and campy and fun to watch.</p>
<p>Also, that Steven Spielberg joke tried WAY too hard.</p>
<p>A fun movie I would watch again, though it won&rsquo;t make any more sense next time, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m not on Tumblr much anymore. Both for Tumblr/social media-y reasons, and for personal ones, but all of them in some way intersect with the concepts of how I spend my time, and how to be more deliberate in doing so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been really into the idea of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb">Indie Web</a> lately, which is a &ldquo;<em>movement</em>&rdquo; but also, more broadly, seems to be a lot of people asking the same sort of questions I&rsquo;ve had for a long time: What is it like to be an average person who wants to express themselves on the internet in This Modern Age? How can people utilize the social, artistic, and documentary strengths of this sort of technology while avoiding everything else that is gross, shallow, and commodifying about the modern web?</p>
<p>Turns out, a lot of folks are just bloggin' it up old school style. I&rsquo;ve been spending a lot of time on various personal webpages, those with frequently-updated blogs, or slow-growing digital gardens, and more. I&rsquo;ve had my own versions of these kinds of sites for quite a while, usually built by hand, but always as an effectively private, inconsistent side-project, never knowing how or if to try and connect/project/broadcast in a broader way.</p>
<p>I am feeling so moved now. I used to think of these kind of personal sites (of mine, at least) as time capsules to be stumbled upon, like discovering someone&rsquo;s old journals at an estate sale. And while I still think that can be true (and is incredibly interesting and worthy as an outcome), I am starting to see new (well actually, <em>old</em>) modes of expression, communication, and community-building slowly snaking vines and roots throughout the current mainstream web.</p>
<p>Having a blog that literally no one is currently looking at is freeing, and also at times soul-crushingly pointless. But who will care what I have to say, right? Reading so many other personal, unfiltered, raw blogs and pages has reminded me that the beauty is in the mundane. The beauty is in the telling and and the seeing. Not necessarily, or exclusively, in what is being told or what is being seen.</p>
<p>Lately I&rsquo;ve been haphazardly posting on my web blog, but that site wasn&rsquo;t connected to any sort of &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; system or larger platform. For a while, that was what I liked about it.  But that&rsquo;s changing. I&rsquo;m still way too self-conscious about all of this to just send someone a URL and ask them to check it out. But I realize I <em>am</em> interested in other people seeing what I post, and engaging with it. There are a few different communities and platforms around now where folks can easily and un-algorithmically bop around and discover other blogs and follow them. But those are still Platforms. And Communities. And the whole reason I&rsquo;ve been rolling my own homepage and blog is to avoid throwing in with any singular place that can change the rules of the game at any time. <sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>And while I don&rsquo;t blog on Tumblr, I do have some followers (somehow) and, as I get braver and more public-facing about posting, I&rsquo;d want them to see what I&rsquo;m putting out. Even if it is just about <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/2024/04/29/unexpected-song.html">showtune-induced ennui</a>&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to experiment with the concept of syndication. Not like an RSS feed (though obviously those exist and I utilize them) but the concept of <a href="https://indieweb.org/POSSE">POSSE</a>: <b>P</b>ublish (on your) <b>O</b>wn <b>S</b>ite, <b>S</b>yndicate <b>E</b>lsewhere.</p>
<p>Because how do you choose just one &ldquo;home&rdquo;? More to the point <em>why</em> should you choose just one?</p>
<p>POSSE type syndication seems to be the answer to all of this. I can post on a blog that I control, but syndicate wherever else I might be interested in. Maybe those syndicated channels have a life of their own, connected to their specific platforms and communities. Maybe those channels serve more as a path back to my self-hosted stuff. Either way, it&rsquo;s an interesting concept that I am excited to play around with.</p>
<p>The thing is, syndication like I envision it would either require manually reposting, or building some Weird Dread Apparatus, frankenstein-ing all these disparate parts together. And while part of me is hunched over my keyboard, rubbing hands together with nerdy glee and quietly cackling to myself, <em>Yes, yessssss&hellip;</em> at the prospect of building such a thing, that&rsquo;s also a large undertaking while I&rsquo;m still very much in the exploratory phase. Plus, I have a habit of going all in on <em>building</em> something online, then lose the momentum when it comes to actually <em>using</em> it.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve decided to split the difference, and move my current, somewhat-rickety blog over to <a href="https://micro.blog/">Micro.blog</a>), and use that to crosspost to Tumblr - while I also vet and explore other communities and platforms to syndicate to. I&rsquo;m really impressed with Micro.blog so far. Because the whole things runs on <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a nerd like me has plenty of fine-tuned control and opportunities for customization - so I can still scratch that &ldquo;building and tweaking things&rdquo; itch - but the nuts and bolts of deployment and hosting are taken care of. In just a couple of days exploring and fiddling with Micro, it has resolved every major and minor inconvenience I experienced with my old stack. And I&rsquo;ve still got a lot of tinkering to do, but that is my favorite part.</p>
<p>So depending on where you are reading this, you may see a footer at the end of the post informing you that this has been syndicated from my homebase web blog of <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/">Scrap of Poetry and Madness</a>. Engage with all of this however you like. Ignore it at your will.</p>
<p>Most importantly, consider how <strong>you</strong> are expressing yourself online. Do you wish there were better ways than just social media? There are, my friend, there are.</p>

<sup id="fn1">1. Not that the personal homepage/blogging platforms I'm thinking of here seem to be in danger of doing that. But still. When someone else ultimately holds the keys to the platform, they hold the keys to your content, and in some ways to your voice.<a href="#ref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.">↩</a></sup>

			 <p>Listening to musicals still makes me sad sometimes. Especially some musicals, and especially some times. It&rsquo;s been nearly twenty years since that part of my life. I never fully closed the door to that part of me, but it&rsquo;s also a room I can&rsquo;t go into completely. It&rsquo;s a room I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever fully inhabit again. And yet.</p>
<p>Shelves of scripts I&rsquo;ll never give away. Soundtracks moved from device to device that I can&rsquo;t listen to anymore. Boxes of programs and cast party souvenirs in the attic.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s cliche to say this, but it was a lifetime ago.  I think back to that period and it&rsquo;s not unfamiliar but it is foreign. Like walking through your childhood home and realizing you aren&rsquo;t in a memory but in a dream that&rsquo;s slowly melting into a nightmare.</p>
<p>But the nightmare isn&rsquo;t now, it was back then, when I violently ripped out that page from my life and tossed it to the wind. Only later realizing there were words on the page I&rsquo;d never see again, never stumble across and only sometimes be able to remember the vague shapes of. Words that were so important to me not just lost but discarded. A secret formula, a spell, a code, a key. Gone.</p>
<p>At the time, I thought my love of theatre defined me. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine myself or my life without that as the foundation. What does that mean now, for the things I see around me that I cling to? The stuff I surround myself with that I hang my identity on?</p>
<p>Maybe its encouraging, empowering even. That part of my life is gone, and yet I remain. Completely different and exactly the same.</p>
<p>There was so much more violently lost back then than just my connection to the stage. So much more pain caused and endured. And yet most of those scars have healed over and I am stronger for it. Leaner. Smarter.</p>
<p>But there was such potential then. I was just starting something, intoxicated with the potential of it all, and I drunkenly wrapped my life around a lamp post. The wounds healed. Relationships irrevocably lost, but hearts grew back. I am better for that time in my life. Much didn&rsquo;t survive the transition. Much did and is stronger as a result. But in between, or maybe holding it all together is&hellip; theatre. That life of mine, just getting started, never to resolve.</p>
<p>Hanging in the air. A ghost light on stage waiting for the next show that will never come. But at least the theater is never truly dark.</p>

			 <p><em>Okay funny story - I wrote the below little post over a year ago, and for some reason, never published it. Instead it was hiding in drafts nearly lost to history and my memory.</em></p>
<p><em>Spoiler Alert: I did end up rejoining Tumblr, but then got back off of it around the change of the year as part of a general rejiggering of my internet/media/art-experiencing habits and routines. I do miss some aspects of Tumblr (again) but not enough to got back&hellip;</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, original year-old post follows:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a service, Tumblr’s lack of commerciality and consistent inability to successfully monetize itself is part of its whole appeal. There’s a whole genre of Tumblr posts that just screenshot and mock the bizarre hosted ads that spawn on the dashboard like mutated fish in a radioactively-poisoned river.</p>
<p>But it’s a loving kind of mockery—users seem, for the most part, to be genuinely grateful for the state of the site. For many, it’s a refuge from the dystopian insanity that the rest of the internet has come to represent. “It’s like anti-social social media,” says Bec, regarding Tumblr’s continued paradoxical appeal.</p>
<p>[…] for those who value creativity without the pressures of “hustle culture,” and wish to avoid the current-events performative outrage that has crept in, kudzu-like, and swallowed up almost every single other area of open expression online, Tumblr remains ideal.</p>
<p>The corollary of that, of course, being that those who appreciate that creativity without necessarily needing or wanting to express it themselves can also find happy homes on Tumblr, as spectators to a healthy culture of simply <em>liking</em> things.</p>

<p>Tumblr was absolutely my social media “home” for a long time - though I never saw it has a social media platform, per se. It was communal blogging and celebration of cool shit. It was the only platform I ever amassed any sort of following on, and the only one I ever saw my self <em>wanting</em> a following on.</p>
<p>I deleted my account and my tumblogs (hell yes, that is what I did and will aways call them) when the porn ban came down - mainly because the site/admins/corporate overlords were handling it, oh <em>so badly</em>. But it sounds like a lot of that has calmed down now…</p>
<p>And now, I’m nostalgic for it? I am feeling… things? This will not do, not at all.</p>
<p>I’m not considering getting back on Tumblr? …am I?</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>

			 <p>I am intimidated. I feel pressured by them.</p>
<p>I understand and agree with their usefulness in the world of &lsquo;blog as archive&rsquo;, but among the other parallel worlds of what a blog can be, I kind of like the ambiguity of posting without them. Does it really matter that you know exactly what day I said this? Or, how close this is, temporally, to the previous post? To the (hopefully) next one?</p>
<p>I mean, it might matter! I don&rsquo;t actually know! I&rsquo;m asking you!</p>

			 <p>Offline, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been spending some time, literally tonight and in general, bopping around the current, uh blogosphere. I’ve found a few sites, I believe from ooh directory that are doing basically the exact thing I could see myself doing which is… this, right now. Except in a blog instead of privately, talking to myself in Notion.</p>
<p>Why <em>not</em> do this in a blog? Why I am here? Because I don’t think anyone will read it? I just read a bunch of random blogs. So its clearly not that hard to get it in front of some eyes.</p>
<p>Because I don’t want to invest the effort? That’s very possible, but that’s also the kind of energy I’m trying to transform.</p>
<p>Because…it will suck? Well probably but that’s a bad reason not to do something.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so, I&rsquo;m here. Again. For the first time. Again.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t need to know how this will all go in order to do it at all. I need to keep telling myself that.</p>
<p>Something I read tonight, from <a href="https://veronique.ink/daily-bloggers/">this new personal blog I discovered</a> discussing their love of &lsquo;daily bloggers&rsquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I also like it when they don’t have all the answers, as prescriptive blogs aren&rsquo;t my jam. The more they write without an overactive filter, the better. It allows me to learn/discover things alongside them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s&hellip; <em>facinating</em>. Because, trying to actually answer my above question of &ldquo;Why am I not just blogging?&rdquo;, I realize a large part of my hesitation to engage with blogging specifically (as opposed developing and writing more polished &ldquo;essay&rdquo; posts (which I don&rsquo;t do much either but for different (bad) reasons&hellip;)) is because I devalue what I write when I &ldquo;write without an overactive filter&rdquo;. I doesn&rsquo;t feel &ldquo;real&rdquo; and I can&rsquo;t imagine anyone would want to read it. I literally don&rsquo;t see the value in it for anyone outside of myself.</p>
<p>&hellip;and then I think of all the time I&rsquo;ve spent reading other people&rsquo;s personal blogs and zines, and things like published diaries, notebooks, sketchbooks, etc.</p>
<p>So yeah. I think I just need to get out of my own way and type stuff on the damn internet. And go from there.</p>
<p>Thanks, <a href="https://veronique.ink/">Veronique.ink</a>!</p>

			 <blockquote>
<p>[Nietzsche] accepts the inevitability and suffering of reality (eternal return) but insists that the person, the self, must change perception. This change of perception must address only oneself, for no other expectation or altered circumstance but only sheer will, insight, and perception, can give us a new ability to understand, tolerate, and transcend suffering. <strong>The present moment of existence must become the tablet on which to etch one’s aspirations, intentions, conclusions, directions, not change any external circumstances but to see through everything, to live in its contradictions.</strong> [Emphasis mine.]</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Eternal return is purgation of past weaknesses, failure, error, desire. The self must embrace not only the will to pursue a new self but what would be associated with Nietzsche as the will to power, meaning no more than the taking control of one’s self in life and destiny. Because this self-made destiny is the fruit of a personal struggle, the self must overcome much that is irrevocably external affecting the inner person. The will must transform the self not through attack but through transvaluation, the will overcoming obstacles, subjectivities, falsehoods, not reliant on society, culture, others, but forging one’s own path and system of thought and values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From: <a href="https://www.hermitary.com/thatch/?p=2330">Eternal Return</a> via <a href="https://www.hermitary.com/thatch/">Hermit&rsquo;s Thatch</a></p>
<p>Once again I&rsquo;ve been thinking about eternal return (heh).</p>
<p>Once again I find myself circling, hovering around the periphery of action.</p>
<p>Once again I find myself going through all of the motions and preparations leading up to an actual change. I make the run up closer than I ever have.</p>
<p>Yet still the gulf remains. The gap. The canyon between me and It.</p>
<p>I have been at this point so many times before.</p>
<p>I just need a better approach, I say. So I retreat back. I plan the route. I clear the path. I wait for favorable weather. The wheel turns again; I set off running. It&rsquo;s easier this time, I am gaining speed. I see the Other Side. I see where I can land. I just need to jump, and&hellip;</p>
<p>And I skid to a stop, right at the edge. Again.</p>
<p>It is easy to get lost in that. Here I am making the same old mistakes. Here I am again, not doing the thing I claim I want to do.</p>
<p>The gravity of my goal, my task, has no doubt captured me. But I can&rsquo;t come into land. I simply spiral tighter and tighter around it. And sometimes I drift away and maybe that&rsquo;s what I need - to let it go and float off somewhere else - but no, at the farthest reaches, the arch of orbit tugs at my back, my retreat slows, and my path bends and I am on the approach again.</p>
<p>How many times will I do this?</p>
<p>But to think that this isn&rsquo;t yet another repeat of every other failed attempt&hellip; to realize that I am not being cursed with another frustrating iteration, but blessed with another chance to get it right&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip;that despite how many times I have found myself here, the only thing that exists is this present moment&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;the person, the self, must change perception.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sometimes, alone, I feel like a ghost. Unmasked, I walk through the world <strong>as if I’m embodying impressions.</strong> I channel the wind, the sadness the rain brings, the spring gloom. My identity is composed of memories, of spirits of places, of things I tell myself, and of things others tell me. I know it’s all in flux. The masks are shifting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…this reminds me of:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,
Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses,
These you presented to me you fish-shaped island,
As I wended the shores I know,
<strong>As I walk’d with that electric self seeking types.</strong></p>

<p>💬 from <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51003/as-i-ebbd-with-the-ocean-of-life">Walt Whitman’s “As I Ebb’d With The Ocean of Life”</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In times of crisis, we set out to find ourselves. Perhaps we will find whatever it is that constitutes <em>us</em> out there in the Himalayas, or somewhere out west. Perhaps we’ll find ourselves in another person who teaches us to see, or in the sun that sets over the Pacific ocean. Often we’ll gain access to another part of ourselves through a story that inspires us.</p>
<p>But this quest to “find yourself” is somewhat self-defeating when the more precise goal ought to be “to create yourself,”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Discovery:</em> Searching for a fixed point; you can miss it, never find it</p>
<p><em>Creation:</em> Always happening, and especially when you realize it, and do with intention. Never has to end. Is complete when you say so…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Hinduism, the ego is a trapping of the physical world. The body is often likened to a flesh tomb, and the ego is like <strong>the glass that contains our true self and shapes it</strong>. The true self—the <em>atman</em> —is a silent, conscious witness. It exists within every creature at its core.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this piece, and find myself returning to it. I’ve read it two or three times already, and though it doesn’t necessarily contain any revolutionary, knock-me-off-my-chair epiphanies, it does that amazing and crucial task of giving form and structure to the kind of wordless questions and wonderings I often have, and allows me to re-engage with them, chew on them in more tangible forms than when they are swimming in my head…</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p><strong>January lasted about 37 days.</strong> It wasn&rsquo;t a bad month, but it was a long month. 2023 has come in like&hellip; a&hellip; Do we even have anything to compare to anymore? Whatever it was, here is how the start of 2023 went for me:</p>
<h2 id="aloy">Aloy</h2>
<p><strong>The month started off with a discovery: Aloy, our kitten 🐈, Champion of the Nora, Savior of Meridian, was&hellip; a boy.</strong> We got Aloy (yes, named after <em>that</em> <a href="https://horizon.fandom.com/wiki/Aloy">Aloy</a>)in late October when they were about two months old. We were told they were female, and had no reason to question that. Since then, three different vets and who-knows-how-many vet techs examined this cat, but it was only as they were literally about to spay her that they realized, hold on, that&rsquo;s a penis.</p>
<p>Our vet called us from the operation, moments before the first cut, and she was so embarrassed. We weren&rsquo;t mad at all, but we were&hellip; surprised. So, Aloy got neutered instead and we had to re-learn our cat&rsquo;s pronouns.</p>
<p>Aloy the Boy got to keep his name, lost his balls, and gained&hellip; a cone.</p>
<p>Oh God, the cone. Could one apparatus simultaneously confer such shame, confusion, rage, humiliation, helplessness, and desperation upon its wearer as this cone did to poor Aloy? The looks of abject sadness. The complete inability to remember how to eat in it, how to drink. The repeated, melodramatic attempts - FLIP, SIGH, PLOP - to get comfortable.</p>
<p>Once the cone was off and new normality was established, it was time to make the basement Aloy-proof, or at least approach that impossible goal as thoroughly as we could. Since his arrival, Aloy had been restricted to roaming the first floor, and I have been working most days up there with him and D. But my office is in the basement, and I was ready to get back down there - though I didn&rsquo;t want to do so until Aloy was ready to have access to expanded territory.</p>
<p>The basement has needed to be cleaned and severely reorganized since the Fall anyway. It wasn&rsquo;t remotely cat safe, but Aloy wasn&rsquo;t remotely cat-responsible enough to be down there, even if it was made &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, until very recently. So over the first few weeks of the month, I cleaned and prepped my office and solidified the main room down there as The Studio, half workout gym/studio for D, half craft/collage/workshop space for both of us. Frankly, the basement has probably never been this clean or organized the whole time we&rsquo;ve lived here. All it took was a tiny cat with apparently confusing genitals.</p>
<h2 id="the-arch-book-etc">The Arch-Book, etc.</h2>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve been puttering around with this blog, my website, and web-related creativity on and off (more &ldquo;off&rdquo;) for a while now.</strong> It&rsquo;s been part of a larger project to pivot how I spend my time, and to engage with new and refined practices and processes. In short, I&rsquo;m trying to live a more deliberate life, spend my time the way I believe I want to, instead of the ways I happen to drift into.  This has manifested in redefining my daily routines, the devices I use, and how I use them.</p>
<p>And somehow as part of that quest, quite randomly, I decided to make my erstwhile Chromebook an intrinsic part of that processes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve discussed <a href="https://write.as/poetry-and-madness/the-origin-of-the-arch-book">elsewhere</a> the project and how unexpectedly it came to be. Basically, my MacBook is getting old, and likes to stay plugged into the wall most of the time, so I needed a device I could bring around the house with me, more focused on typing and creating content. The MacBook&rsquo;s battery has been flakey for a while, and I&rsquo;ve been working around that by just&hellip; not doing the sort of generative, creative work I claim to want to do. With the MacBook downstairs plugged in and a new cat upstairs quite literally demanding my attention, it was the perfect excuse to keep kicking the can. Until one day, I picked up the can, opened it, and out popped the peanut brittle snakes of a knotty hardware project.</p>
<p>So for about 10 days, I spent nearly every moment of spare time learning how to install and use Linux on a machine intended to serve a purpose I have to some degree been avoiding for&hellip; twenty years? And it&rsquo;s&hellip; worked?</p>
<p>Creating the <code>arch-book</code> and redistributing my digital life across a different arrangement of devices naturally triggered many knock-on projects, but the majority of them were all still aligned with my larger set of goals: spend my time deliberately, facilitate meaningful reading/watching/listening experiences, build creative and journalistic practices.</p>
<p>By the end of the month, by and large the infrastructure of this part of my life is up and running. It will always be an active process; there will be endless tweaking (both with Linux, and my life), but so far the maintenance hasn&rsquo;t over-shadowed the actual work I want to get done. The <code>arch-book</code> sits right in the middle of all of this, and besides being an important cog, and a valuable tech project&hellip; it&rsquo;s just damn fun to use.</p>
<h2 id="building-creating-etc">Building, Creating, etc.</h2>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve been more active on this blog, comparatively speaking.</strong> Although, as you can see it took my until late February to actually finish and post this January recap so let&rsquo;s just keep things in perspective, right?</p>
<p>Anyhoo, I have been puttering away on <a href="https://homomonstrosus.com/">Homo Monstrosus</a>, tweaking, fussing, etc., and actually updating the <a href="https://homomonstrosus.com/now/">/now</a> page I built in the Fall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also finally completed a several-year (albeit with huuuuuge gaps) project of organizing and cataloging my personal digital photo archive. Most significantly, I&rsquo;ve made dozens of themed albums, in part for personal organization, but also so that I can begin to go through these photos and albums, and begin to create themed public galleries to be posted&hellip; somewhere. I&rsquo;m still figuring that part out. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always thought in a different universe I would have got deep into photography. I took 3 years of (film) photography classes in high school and by the end was developing color photos by hand. That was nearly the post-high school path I took. Maybe it should have been? Another post, for another day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to sharing the pictures I have taken with&hellip; whatever random internet weirdos happen to find this place. Welcome weirdos, I am one of you. Take me in and share your weird secrets with me. I&rsquo;ll show you cool pictures of cats and flowers and the sky.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p><strong>I want to read more this year</strong>, but I&rsquo;m also broadly focused on taking stock of what is around me, clearing out archives, and being deliberate with that reading - especially internet-based reading. I&rsquo;ve been pruning my digital inputs, trying to remove sites and apps that I don&rsquo;t actually <em>engage</em> with, but rather keep scrolling through hoping for a hit of dopamine.</p>
<p>This tactic, of locking myself in a playpen with options, but healthy, curated ones is something I&rsquo;ve been implementing in stages since the Fall, and it seems to be working for me. To that end, instead of scrolling Instagram, or the algorithmically-focused-on-outrage news app, I&rsquo;ve been diving through my embarrassingly huge <a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> archive, and even stepped back in time and set up a good old fashioned feed reader with limited and deliberate subscriptions. I no longer want access to anything and everything I might want to read; I want easy, direct, no-distraction access to a few, carefully selected feeds from sources I am looking forward to reading each time they post. I don&rsquo;t want to skim, to get the gist. I want to engage and build relationships with pieces, authors, and sources.</p>
<p>At some point, I should probably document here the feeds I do follow and consume regularly (Man, people really seem to hate that word, &ldquo;consume&rdquo;&hellip; I recognize how it can be seen as a shallow replacement for engagement, but to me it also can have connotations of engaging-with-wholehearted-aplomb. Devouring, etc.), but for now I just want to mention the current highlight and darling of my regular &lsquo;net-based reading has been the posting of British author <a href="https://tom-cox.com/?post_type=post">Tom Cox</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get like this sometimes, lose my focus, then reel it back in. It’s part of the pattern, inevitable, crucial. But I notice I need to guard against it more than I did in the past. It’s the incessant, troubling speed of everything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://tom-cox.com/writing/the-incessant-troubling-speed-of-everything/">Source</a></em></p>
<p>I love his style, from his <a href="https://tom-cox.com/writing/darkening-days-in-summerland-a-personal-compendium/">journal-style compendium posts</a> to his more creative and <a href="https://tom-cox.com/writing/some-recommended-walks/">wonderfully weird</a> writing and ramblings. Probably the most excited I&rsquo;ve been to find a new writer in a long time. Now I should probably read his books&hellip;
<br /></p>
<p><strong>Perhaps the only thing more embarrassing and daunting than my Pocket queue is my comic book backlog.</strong> The good news about such a large backlog is that I can grab literally anything from it and find something I enjoy. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been devouring <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog</strong> comics, the most recent run, available with my Comixology Unlimited subscription. These aren&rsquo;t the deepest and most life-changing books, but they are fun as heck, vibrantly drawn and colored, and a wonderful companion to <em>Sonic Frontiers</em>.</p>
<p>However, for something with more artistic substance and depth, I finally started Kelly Sue DeConnicks&rsquo;s incredible, revolutionary and beautiful <em>Wonder Woman Historia: The Amazons</em> series. There&rsquo;s no way in a few lines to describe how great and intense this book is, from the writing to the jaw-dropping art. Just read it. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m doing. First two issues down, though I keep re-reading them instead of moving on the third. Like <em>Sonic Frontiers</em>, I just don&rsquo;t want it to be over&hellip;
<br /></p>
<p><strong>For Christmas, D got me the collected poetry of Gary Snyder</strong>. Despite being and English major and loving poems, I can&rsquo;t remember if I&rsquo;ve ever sat down with a book of poetry and just went through it beginning to end, page by page. I&rsquo;ve read a lot of say, Whitman, but by bouncing around from thing to thing, following threads and thoughts, flipping to random pages, etc. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that approach; it&rsquo;s organic and leads to wonderful discoveries, but this time, I wanted to try something more measured.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve made it through <em>Riprap</em>, Snyder&rsquo;s first collection, and loved it. Poetry in general is a real challenge to me in a lot of ways. It must be sipped, cannot be gulped. It openly mocks and destroys the &ldquo;pages-per-day&rdquo; type quantification I usually plan and measure my reading habit in. This is exactly why I need it in my life. Interaction with poetry takes as long as it takes, and rewards not by completion but engagement.</p>
<p>Reading <em>Riprap</em> has made me want to reread <em>Dharma Bums</em>, where I was first introduced to Snyder via Kerouac. I didn&rsquo;t get to start the novel in January. Let&rsquo;s see if that&rsquo;s something that shows up in the February recap&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="and-in-the-remaining-hours">And in the remaining hours&hellip;</h2>
<p><strong>I didn&rsquo;t game nearly as much as I thought I would in January</strong>, mainly because I spent so much of my free time working on the above mentioned projects. I am always so hot and cold with this sort of thing, I either do nothing but game - often at the detriment to anything else I want to engage with - or I don&rsquo;t touch the controller for weeks, absorbed in other things. I really would like balance. Some of everything. Slow, steady movement forward through a few different streams. That is something I am working towards, trying to train myself for - though I wonder if it is something that is even possible for me, and if I should just embrace this particular part of my nature. But that&rsquo;s a whole other post for another time.</p>
<p>I did play <em>Sonic Frontiers</em>, which I started essentially the day it came out in December. I absolutely adore it - and Sonic in general - but as alluded to earlier, I admit I&rsquo;ve been slow to finish it, in part because I just don&rsquo;t want it to be over. This is why I have never actually finished <em>Breath of the Wild</em> despite it being possibly my favorite game ever and having it since 2017.</p>
<p>I also started and got a fair way through <em>Final Fantasy Adventure</em> for the Game Boy via the <em>Collection of Mana</em> for the Switch. I got that compilation for <em>Secrets</em> and <em>Trials of Mana</em>, which I&rsquo;ve never played and only recently heard of (I was a Sega kid, hence the Sonic obsession). But I am weird about starting at the beginning of series, and a sucker for Game Boy games, and so had to dive into this one. So far, despite its age and related clunkiness, I am enjoying it a lot, and the chance to name the two main characters after both our current cat and our recently departed one has been unexpectedly meaningful&hellip;</p>
<p>(The main hero is male, and I decided to name him after Aloy before we actually discovered his true sex. An interesting premonition?)
<br /></p>
<p><strong>A great addition to this year has been me and D&rsquo;s decision to commit to weekly movie nights.</strong> We both love movies and always want to watch more, but as with so many things we just&hellip; don&rsquo;t, at least not regularly. But in December, D said enough was enough and she watched 31 movies in 31 days! I watched most of them with her and was vaguely around for the rest and while that kind of hyper-focus is a lot even for me, it inspired us to try and commit to a movie-watching practice in 2023 that was perhaps a little more manageable. So enter Weekly Movie Night! In January we watched:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Knives Out</em></li>
<li><em>Only Lovers Left Alive</em></li>
<li><em>Jurassic World</em></li>
<li><em>Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, we&rsquo;re going to alternate picking movies, with <em>Knives Out</em> being my first pick and <em>Only Lovers</em>, D&rsquo;s. But we also decided to go through the <em>Jurassic World</em> Trilogy with my dad, which none of us had seen yet (the movies, not my dad - we can see him, and do, fairly regularly). Every movie we&rsquo;ve watched so far has been highly enjoyable, with the first two quickly becoming deep favorites for me and D. <em>Fallen Kingdom</em> is the weak link of the bunch, but I still enjoyed it and am a sucker for the entire larger franchise and am looking forward to finishing it out in February.</p>
<h2 id="and-further-on">&hellip;and further on</h2>
<p><strong>That was January.</strong> It was&hellip; a lot? And by that, I mean, I did a lot? I just can&rsquo;t help ending those sentences with question marks because I am still not used to the fact that I am, indeed, Doing Things. The Things I want to be doing, no less. I don&rsquo;t expect February to have the same sort of momentum (spoiler alert: it does not) but I have enough moving that I am optimistic I can build on this month, lay down more coats on this foundation, and continue to make incremental progress on the things that are important to me.</p>
<p>And if all else fails, there is still cat. Good cat. Pretty cat. Speaking of, behold, <strong>Aloy, Prince of Cones</strong> 📷:</p>
<p><img src="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/uploads/2024/prince-of-cones.jpg" alt="A kitten lies on a large pillow wearing a cone around his neck to prevent him from licking stitches, earning him the nickname, The Prince of Cones. He looks adorable and exasperated."></p>
<p>Cat tax paid. See you next month!</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>What began as an impulsive project on a Friday afternoon turned into a 4 - 5 day <em>extravaganza</em>.</p>
<p>The <strong><code>arch-book</code></strong> is actually a <strong>Dell Chromebook 11</strong> from a few years ago. It is old enough that the newer ChromeOS updates didn&rsquo;t run great on it, but it is otherwise a good machine with a nice, simple, utilitarian form factor. I really like it, and always lamented never using it to its fullest potential.  A few years ago, I messed around with putting GalliumOS on it. That was fine but a) I never worked on it long enough to get all of the kinks out, and 2) I never really decided <em>how</em> I would use it once it was set up. I never integrated it into my daily practice and habits. And that was fine, I suppose; it was a hobby project. But I still felt like I was wasting a cool piece of tech.</p>
<p>Then last week with no warning, I decided to dust off this machine to see if I can make it a usable part of my day-to-day practice.</p>
<p>My goals for this machine are to be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>write markdown in a lightweight editor</li>
<li>browse the internet for blog posting, research, and light account/website maintenance</li>
<li>BONUS: update <a href="https://homomonstrosus.com/">homomonstrosus.com</a> in a simple, lightweight development environment</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. I didn&rsquo;t want a whole office suite or full connectivity to all of my ecosystems all the time. And perhaps most importantly, I didn&rsquo;t want a general purpose device that could do a bit of everything. I like using this thing; I like playing with it. If I made it so it could do <em>anything</em>, all I&rsquo;d end up doing on it would be path-of-least-resistance type stuff.</p>
<p>Instead, I wanted, Oh, you like playing with this? Well all it is, is a tool for <em>writing</em>. If you&rsquo;re going to use it, you&rsquo;re going to use it for that. For <strong>creation</strong>. I hoped that could trick myself into finding excuses to use it, and therefore to write&hellip; and I think its working.</p>
<p>I will admit I was somewhat inspired by <em>Only Lovers Left Alive</em> in this project. I loved how Adam built all of these wonderful systems with old, &ldquo;outdated&rdquo; tech. I loved the idea that someone living through all of this technoligical change wouldn&rsquo;t need to be cutting edge. If something <strong>worked</strong> why move on to the next iteration simply because it was the next? There&rsquo;s no reason things can&rsquo;t be improved and integrated without being abandoned.</p>
<p>With these goals in mind - actually, I couldn&rsquo;t say that. This project was so impulsive, I can&rsquo;t say I had <em>any</em> goal in mind when I started it. I didn&rsquo;t even set out to start a project per se. I randomly wanted to dust off this machine. Does it still work? Yeah? Oh, GalliumOS is shutting down? Damn. Can I put something else on it? Cool, I&rsquo;ll do that.</p>
<p>And thus a thread was pulled and&hellip; here we are, almost a week later.</p>
<p>This all happened in the way it did because I found a very thorough guide tailored not just to Chromebooks, but to THIS Chromebook, the <strong>Dell Chromebook 11</strong> here:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dell_Chromebook_11</code></li>
</ul>
<p>&hellip;and that&rsquo;s what caused me to put <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> on it. I just wanted <em>something</em> and Arch had a detailed walk-through, so&hellip; sure! Later, deep in the process, I did start to remember some things I learned the last time I tiptoed into linux: that Arch is a little more dense or at least a little more <em>hands on</em>&hellip; and that it didn&rsquo;t come with a visual environment. But since I kind of blustered into this project in the first place, I just kept lumbering along, working through things. It was challenging but rewarding and continues to be so. Most of the time -</p>
<p>&hellip;I just had to stop in the middle of this entry to go figure out why spellchecking wasn&rsquo;t working in my text editor. It was a bit of a wild goose chase. I came away knowing a little more about how linux, etc. works, but also realizing that 90% of my issues are from typos/details I miss.</p>
<p>Setting up this machine has been ripe with these whack-a-mole sessions. I honestly do enjoy fixing and learning from them, but they also impede my momentum to actually get USING this thing. Every other step I take towards daily use I need to divert and walk around for 5 miles fixing some random issue. I am hoping that this sort of things tapers off the closer I get running this through my daily routines.</p>
<p>ANYWAY.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I did:</p>
<h2 id="1-mrchromebox">1. mrchromebox</h2>
<p>A few years ago, to get GalliumOS on this thing, I did&hellip; uh something to the BIOS? It wasn&rsquo;t bad - I didn&rsquo;t mess anything up - I just don&rsquo;t remember what exactly I did. Whatever it was, it came with an (known) issue where if the battery got completely drained, I&rsquo;d have to manually enable a certain kind of boot mode before I could load linux again. And I used the machine just infrequently enough that I never remembered exactly how to do it and had to look it up and stumble through the process every time.</p>
<p>So at least this time, I decided to commit, and to follow these:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>https://mrchromebox.tech/#fwscript</code></li>
<li><code>https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Chrome_OS_devices#Legacy_Boot_Mode</code></li>

<p>Was having an issue where, after a certain amount of time (like, hours), sleep mode would crash and reboot the computer. Did a lot of digging and went down some wrong paths. Ultimately, it seems to be a deep google problem with a known bug messing up the S3 sleep cycle(s):</p>
<p><em>(Can&rsquo;t find the link to the bug report! Take my word for it!)</em></p>
<p>My workaround has been to switch to a lighter sleep by setting this in <code>sleep.conf</code> :</p>

</ul>
<p>&hellip;which avoids the behavior. I can sleep and wake up just fine, I just save less battery in this lighter sleep. Not thrilled with that, but at least its I can suspe.</p>
<p>This is another opportunity to travel light and lean. And save often.</p>
<hr>
<p>By now, the whack-a-mole is dying down, and I&rsquo;m starting to integrate this into my daily life, along with other habits I&rsquo;m trying to cultivate. I&rsquo;m working to build a cyclic relationship being daily reading and daily writing - journalling, logging, etc.</p>
<p>So far so good. The <code>arch-book</code> is becoming my go-to digital capture device. I&rsquo;m starting to use it like a digital notebook, and learning how it can compliment my paper notebooks. The separation of concerns between all of these devices, and the iPad, is working so far. Just a little friction to make the system tactile.</p>
<p>Downstairs the macbook anchors this system, though now tethered to power most of the time. They are the workhorse, holding it all together. Things feel a little tenous, but I like stitching things together and am up for the challenge.</p>

			 <p>In <a href="https://poetryandmadness.micro.blog/2022/07/11/project-log-jul.html">my last post</a> here, I was so worried about the precedent numbered entries in a series would set, I didn&rsquo;t define the scope of the series itself well enough. Or if I did, I don&rsquo;t remember.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t everything I write here a &ldquo;process log&rdquo;? This is a web log after all (since I am, for some reason, so set on using that particular antiquated phrase&hellip;)</p>
<p>So here I am! Making progress on my process and uh&hellip; logging it!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve updated <a href="https://homomonstrosus.com/">Homo Monstrosus</a>, in both style and content. And the site has been on my mind more and more - as a tool, a project, a hobby, but also as a shelter, a record, a showcase. Creating and building in general has been on my mind more too, but the front, active part of it, rather than the back(burner), &ldquo;sigh, one day&hellip;&rdquo; part. I am almost building a creative practice. Or rather, I <strong>am</strong> building a creative practice, it&rsquo;s just wobbly like a baby deer. Spooks easily like one too.</p>
<p>I am still iterating over exactly how I want to exist on the web. Still trying to crystalize and differentiate the ways one can publish web content. I&rsquo;m not talking on a global, capitalism scale, or about being a Content Creator on a social media website or anything like that. I&rsquo;m talking about one person, making (mostly) words and publishing them using the networked tools they have access to.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking about the difference between pages that are designed to be dynamic and updated, versus static and time-locked. The blogging revolution brought web publishing to the masses, but it also came with this subconscious implication that the only valid content on the web was the newest, most current, whatever was at the top of the blog. And with <em>that</em> came the idea that &ldquo;old&rdquo; content was somehow less-than. Or that unchanging content, whether by design or as an artifact didn&rsquo;t have a place on the web. Couldn&rsquo;t be trusted. Or maybe those are just implications I wrestled with.</p>
<p>What do I want to make? Why? Who is it for? <strong>When</strong> is it for?</p>
<p>These are much more potent and healthy questions than the ones I&rsquo;d traditionally ask like, Can I even make anything? Who do I think I am? Why haven&rsquo;t I done more? Should I just stop kidding myself?</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s other stuff on my mind. World stuff, obviously. But World-level internet stuff too. It seems very popular these last few months to acknowledge that the web and capitalism appear to be inexorably linked, and that the coupling is killing us, leading us and the planet herself to doom. And that&rsquo;s not wrong, of course, but the situation was incredibly apparent well before Elon Musk said he wanted to buy Twitter (though that event, at least to me, seems to have kicked off the lastest wave of these kind of think pieces&hellip; and again, that&rsquo;s not an inappropriate response.)</p>
<p>But as much as I generally agree with the sentiment - that&rsquo;s not where I want to live right now. The internet hasn&rsquo;t been what I&rsquo;ve wanted it to be in a long time, well before I realized it. I can&rsquo;t dismantle those systems.</p>
<p>I <em>can</em> chip away at my little site. Plod around this blog. Build my little chicken coop as the cathedrals fall to the shelling.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m going to do.</p>

			 <p>The work of my life, at the moment, appears to be centered around living and acting deliberately. I say &ldquo;appears&rdquo; because the more I try to do the Work of Life the more I realize I am discovering it rather than creating it. And like all white male explorers, &ldquo;discovering&rdquo; means &ldquo;finding and realizing things that people who don&rsquo;t look like me embraced and celebrated long, long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right now, this work is manifesting in:</p>
<h2 id="the-path">&ldquo;The Path&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Daily reading and study into spiritual systems, paths, and modes of thought</strong>, from a perch somewhere between skeptic and seeker. I am just starting this practice, mainly stemming from a desire to spend some daily(ish) time on &ldquo;matters of the soul&rdquo; - whatever that may mean. Right now that means re-reading one of my favorite nonfiction books, Huston Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;The World&rsquo;s Religions&rdquo;. I read an utterly beleaguered, decades old, mass market copy of &ldquo;The Religions of Man&rdquo; as the book was known in the 70&rsquo;s, and inspired in me some spiritual exploration. I think I am hoping it does it again&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="the-roles">&ldquo;The Roles&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Abstracting my goals, desires, and pulls into the concept of &ldquo;roles&rdquo; I want to embody.</strong> I plan to write about this more at length soon. I&rsquo;m not sure how much I&rsquo;ll get into the personal side of this, but the general idea is that rather than looking at my life as a list of tasks I want to do, or accomplishments I want to rack up, it has helped me to instead envision the archetypal (if only to me) roles, personas or&hellip; something close to a D&amp;D class, that I want to embody and explore in my own context. Sounds weird - and it is - but it has also unlocked my brain in certain ways, giving me new and flexible ways to view my life and the things I want to do, and how that informs &ldquo;the person I want to be&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This way of looking at my life has also lent itself very well to other projects like&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="the-planner">&ldquo;The Planner&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Developing and iterating over a personal organization system.</strong> I learned long ago I will likely not succeed in a system created by someone else, but for a long time I thought that let me off the hook of having to put the work in to make one myself. I was wrong. I call this project The Planner, though it is not really a &ldquo;planner&rdquo; or &ldquo;datebook&rdquo; or &ldquo;organizer&rdquo; in the traditional sense. The Planner is the tool, or set of tools, I use to organize and manage my time, and to help me catalogue and prioritize what I want to focus on. When those things happen in concert, the Planner turns &ldquo;time&rdquo; from a vague, ephemeral substance to a finite, consumable resource, a fuel.</p>
<p>The difference between trying to Do Things without the Planner and with it is the difference between trying to get a Delorean up to 88 MPH in 1885 vs 2015. Without the Planner, to Do Things requires crazy contraptions, mad thinking, and completely impractical and ridiculously inefficient methods of propulsion best suited for singular, Hail Mary moments. With the Planner? I can throw any old junk in my reactor and jet around through time and space causing trouble all I want. AND I get a hover conversion.</p>
<p><em>(Wow this post has gone off the rails and right into Clint Eastwood Ravine&hellip;)</em></p>
<p>Or rather, this would all be true, if the Planner was actually a thing. Now it only exists as the platonic idea of the system I aspire too. But the working prototype I&rsquo;m up to now is the best, most flexible version I&rsquo;ve had yet. Integrating the &ldquo;roles&rdquo; concept above adds a narrative element to something usually heavy with charts, lists and flow charts. And lucky for me I love narrative elements AND flow charts.</p>
<h2 id="the-work">&ldquo;The Work&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Developing a practice of making/reflecting/recording&hellip;stuff. And things.</strong> Most of my life, I have wanted to create and communicate creatively with the world. I started out in theatre. In my adult life I have settled more into written expression, but that description feels&hellip; limiting. In fact for a long time my byline was &ldquo;I like making things with words.&rdquo; Which is true! Fiction, poetry, but also plays, and code, and zines, and essays, and letters, and&hellip; and&hellip;</p>
<p>These are things I would like to create, and I have an inconsistent archive (at best) of various attempts over the years. I have made a few Things I am quite proud of; but what I&rsquo;ve never made is a practice of creating them. I can rise to the occasion of an assignment and deadline like nobody&rsquo;s business, but I&rsquo;ve never been able to create those stakes for myself. In lieu of someone else&rsquo;s gun to my head, I need to find away to hold my own&hellip;</p>
<p>Nope. Not even going to go there.</p>
<h2 id="the-lexicon">&ldquo;The Lexicon&rdquo;</h2>
<p><strong>Building the language and grammar to describe everything above.</strong> All of these projects I&rsquo;m working on fit together and interact in ways that I&rsquo;m not going to describe here, in part because I&rsquo;m still discovering it myself. The questions I&rsquo;m trying to answer, the practices I&rsquo;m trying to start, they all swirl around the larger work of finding my place, my way - a project so big it has multiple times swallowed me up deep into its void only to toss my lightyears away, alone and disoriented. It&rsquo;s hard enough to keep my head above water when I can&rsquo;t even talk things through to myself without tripping over the words.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One day I will find the right words, and they will be simple</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to stop waiting and make that day now. I need the right buckets to sort thoughts and meanings into and finding those buckets is so much harder than it sounds. But having that right word, it&rsquo;s not just a bucket, it&rsquo;s a handle, to pick up an idea and turn it into a tool.</p>
<p>And so part of this particular project is giving names to&hellip; all the projects. Which I did! Helpful!</p>
<hr>
<p>At a high level, these are the things I am most excited about, the things - in a certain context - I want to invest my time and energy in, and the things that I believe will give my life meaning. So, I hope to keep a log of how all of these projects are going, what new projects they spawn, and any notable results from the lot of them.</p>
<p>I hope that this space can evolve to be so much more than a process log, but I would also be ecstatic if I maintain it even as just that for any length of time. A process log, perhaps more than anything I could do here, would embody my philosophy for this place, best summed up as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What I write here is not my teaching, but my study; it is not a lesson for others, but for me. And yet it should not be held against me if I publish what I write. What is useful to me may also by accident be useful to another. Moreover, I am not spoiling anything, I am only using what is mine. And if I play the fool, it is at my expense and without harm to anyone. For it is a folly that will die with me, and will have no consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Montaigne, by way of <a href="https://warrenellis.ltd/jot/not-my-teaching-but-my-study/">Warren Ellis</a></p>
<p><em>Here&rsquo;s to no consequences&hellip;</em></p>

			 <p>It is, of course, a cardinal sin to blog about blogging, but it might be even more disrespectful of one&rsquo;s time to use tools without thought and deliberate intention. And this place is a tool, among other things.</p>
<p><strong>I cleaned out and pulled down the previous iteration of this blog.</strong> Didn&rsquo;t throw anything away, never do. In fact, someday I&rsquo;d really like to create one, consolidated (final?) repository of <em>all</em> of my online writing attempts from across the years and frameworks and services. (#TODO) A single archive could inadvertently make all of this look intentional. Despite how much time I obsess over places like this, I am often a long way from being <em>deliberate</em> with them.</p>
<p>In such an archive, you would also see just how much of my online writing chases its own tail, compelled to try and justify its existence. Trying and failing, because if you worry about that, you&rsquo;ve missed the point. it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
<p>And so, I will aim to avoid that here. There&rsquo;s no need to over-complicate this. This is a web log after all, so I am going to try to bring the medium back to its roots: this is a log of what I am doing in and around the web. That&rsquo;s a good place to start. Or, how about this? <strong>this is a log of my life, on the web.</strong>  Even better. Ambiguity intentional.</p>
<p>this blog is part of a larger system I am building to catalog and engage with my life in creative and interesting ways. the desire to create, hone, and theoretically master these kinds of systems is maybe the great pursuit of my life.</p>
<p>this writing does not need to justify its own existence. But there is power in defining terms, in naming names, and stating intentions. I have learned that saying things out loud can make real. It activates them, in a way for me. it gives me permission to say and believe them myself.</p>
<p>Much of the work I&rsquo;ve been doing lately is to settle on an internal vocabulary and grammar to guide my experiences. I am not surprised that work shows up here. But it is a process I don&rsquo;t want to obsess over. I need language to help me move more freely, not to slow me down. I should hope to have a similar relationship with this blog.</p>
<p>one way to look at this blog is as a tool. another is as a medium. For me the two  meanings can kind of blend together. a painting is the painter&rsquo;s tool (<em>to do what?</em> #comeback) <em>and</em> their media. one can consider this blog from a similar place.</p>
<p>right now, my list of tools has been whittled down to what I hope are the essentials:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>this blog: a public living document. a process log. a workshop. a testing ground. an open mic. a bulletin board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>my <a href="https://homomonstrosus.com/">website</a>: a library. a showcase. a temple. a garden. a workshop. and a graveyard. or it could be those things, one day. also: a white whale</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notebooks: a variety of interconnected journals that are private, analog, but otherwise not that ideologically different than my digital projects - that is - they seek to interestingly and beautifully organize and communicate information</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>that last point is significant. Much of what I do is about trying to organize and express information in interesting and attractive ways. I <strong>also</strong> want to <em>create</em> engaging and impressive information. These two drives are related, but are not the same pull.</p>
<p>these are my current tools of expression. or modes. they are not the end results as much as the vehicles. And like many vehicles, they are as fun to tinker with as they are to pilot.</p>
<p>my goals are to use them efficiently and effectively, but also to enjoy them. one role of this blog is to catalog that journey, along with being an artifact of it, in itself.</p>
<p>This is the first step on a road I&rsquo;ve been on many many times. This time, the log is running. May it be of use to someone.</p>

			 <p>Well, I&rsquo;m 39 now. Have been for almost 30 hours. So far, so good (all things considered).</p>
<p>And boy oh boy, do I consider ALL the things.</p>
<p>In fact, it feels like I&rsquo;ve done nothing for the last 2+ years but consider all the things. In my defense, there&rsquo;s been a lot to consider. But, as is my custom, I&rsquo;ve become fed up with considering and need to do&hellip; something. And this is about the place that I never get past. The precipice of Something. It&rsquo;s always the same. Some arbitrary &lsquo;new beginning&rsquo;. Seizing the supposed energy that comes with a new week, a new month, a new pen, a new notebook, a new year. Because, &lsquo;this time&rsquo; it will be different. However by &lsquo;this time&rsquo; + two weeks it will be basically the same as it ever was.</p>
<p>Even this, the wry but frustrated observation of past cycles, the &lsquo;first post in months&rsquo; that is destined to be come &lsquo;the last update in weeks&rsquo;,  the soft &lsquo;but maybe&hellip;&rsquo; whispering in the back of my head. The sad sigh that follows. I&rsquo;ve done it all before.</p>
<p>And so, I am embarrassed.  So often have I tried to jump start something that isn&rsquo;t a car engine. So often have I postured, trying on the costume of the person I want to become, standing in front of the mirror going, &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t it just be <em>wild</em> if I just <em>wore</em> this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time will be different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, things are certainly&hellip; different. Pandemic. War. And the careening, bucking, lurching, drunken networked, polarized society we live in just throwing itself against the walls of its cage. I can honestly say that life at 39 is different than I expected. I don&rsquo;t know that I ever actually sat down and considered what it would be like to be 39. But I do know I wouldn&rsquo;t have ever considered it would be&hellip; like this.</p>
<p>So I guess that means it can be anything, that I can be anything.</p>
<p>It means I don&rsquo;t actually have to come out here and pay my dues by bleeding all over the blogpost, by being just self-deprecating enough, by noting for the record how stupid or privileged or pointless this whole endeavor is, by winkingly insulting myself to wrestle the privilege away from anyone else.</p>
<p>It means that I can just&hellip; do what I want. Type what I want. Take pictures of what I want. Post what I want, build what I want. Perhaps more importantly, it means I don&rsquo;t have to do&hellip; any of it. I can just be.</p>
<p>I am sick of death. Lately that is the dense, gaping black hole that lives in the back of my head and perpetually and eventually tugs at all of my thoughts. I can&rsquo;t lose any more down that drain. I need to do&hellip; anything else.</p>
<p>And so, I am.</p>
